//         "Rules of Hooks\n\nHooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n\nHooks are JavaScript functions, but you need to follow two rules when using them. We provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically:\n\nOnly Call Hooks at the Top Level\n\nDon‚Äôt call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That‚Äôs what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls. (If you‚Äôre curious, we‚Äôll explain this in depth below.)\n\nOnly Call Hooks from React Functions\n\nDon‚Äôt call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:\n\n‚úÖ Call Hooks from React function components.\n\n‚úÖ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we‚Äôll learn about them on the next page).\n\nBy following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code.\n\nTl;dr",

//       // "What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you hook into React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We‚Äôll learn other Hooks later. When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. Were going to do that right now! \n\nTl;dr",
